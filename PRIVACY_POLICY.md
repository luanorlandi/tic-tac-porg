# Privacy Police

I use Google Analytics as a third party tracking service, but I donâ€™t use it to track you individually or collect your User Personal Information. I use Google Analytics to collect information about how my website performs and how my users, in general, navigate through and use Tic-Tac-Porg. This helps me evaluate my users' use of Tic-Tac-Porg; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve my content and website performance.

Google Analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp, and similar data about your use of Tic-Tac-Porg. I do not link this information to any of your personal information such as your user name.

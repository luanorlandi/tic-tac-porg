# Privacy Police

I use Google Analytics and Facebook App as third party tracking services, but I don't use them to track you individually or your User Personal Information.

## Google Analytics

I use Google Analytics to collect information about how my website performs and how users, in general, navigate through and use the website. This helps me evaluate users' usage; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve content and website performance.

Google Analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp, and similar data about your access. I do not link this information to any of your personal information such as your user name.

## Facebook App

I use Facebook App to provide share features on the website for users, including counters of how many users shared the website so far. Facebook App provides a tracking service similarly, but not equally, to Google Analytics, my intentions with his usage remains the same.
